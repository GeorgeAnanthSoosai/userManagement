          If anything is unclear please make reasonable assumptions, document them, and write the code with those assumptions in mind. Please write your program as if it were for production use, including whatever comments, test cases, and documentation you think are necessary. The code must be stable, maintainable, and bug free. Please include something we can use to demonstrate that your answer is correct.  For example, a test / unit test program, documentation, or whatever you think will help us. Code as much as you can. If you cannot complete the challenge, at least show some design/code flow for the parts you could not complete.
